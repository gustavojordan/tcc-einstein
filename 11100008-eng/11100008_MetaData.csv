1,"Information on the data source, the historical availability, definitions of the terms used, and the geographies available can be found at <a href=""http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/olc-cel/olc?ObjId=72-212-X&ObjType=2&lang=en&limit=0""> Technical Reference Guide for the Annual Income Estimates for Census Families, Individuals and Seniors</a>. Because they are based on a different methodology, estimates of the number of individuals and census families presented in this table differ from estimates produced by Demography Division. For questions and comments, please contact the Income Statistics Division of Statistics Canada (income@statcan.gc.ca)."
2,"Tax filers are people who filed a tax return for the reference year and were alive at the end of the year."
3,"Dependant is a member of a family who did not file a personal income tax return for the referenced year."
4,"Characteristics such as age are as of December 31 of the reference year."
5,"Total income is income from all sources. A detailed definition of what is included in total income is available from the <a href=""http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/olc-cel/olc?ObjId=72-212-X&ObjType=2&lang=en&limit=0""> Technical Reference Guide for the Annual Income Estimates for Census Families, Individuals and Seniors</a>."
6,"Median is the middle number in a group of numbers. Where a median income, for example, is given as $26,000, it means that exactly half of the incomes reported are greater than or equal to $26,000, and that the other half is less than or equal to the median amount. Starting in 2007, median incomes in the data tables are rounded to the nearest ten dollars (prior to 2007 they were rounded to the nearest hundred dollars). Zero values are not included in the calculation of medians for individuals."
7,"The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Ottawa-Gatineau straddles the provincial borders of Ontario and Quebec. Three census agglomerations (CA) also straddle provincial borders: Campbellton straddles New Brunswick and Quebec, Hawkesbury straddles Ontario and Quebec, and Lloydminster straddles Alberta and Saskatchewan. Data for the combined provincial parts are provided at the end of the list of CMAs and CAs. Prior to 2008, data for the two parts of the Ottawa-Gatineau CMA may be added together to provide a total for the area, with the exception of medians, percentages, indexes and averages."
8,"Saguenay, formerly Chicoutimi-Jonquière; Greater Sudbury, formerly Sudbury; Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo, formerly Kitchener; Abbotsford-Mission, formerly Abbotsford; Temiskaming Shores, formerly Haileybury."
10,"Information for children between 0 and 18 years of age are derived from a variety of sources, including the tax file, a file pertaining to Federal Child Benefits and provincial birth files."
11,"The Census Standard Geographical Classification (SGC) is used for data dissemination of the census metropolitan areas and the census agglomerations: from 1997 to 2001, SGC 1996; from 2002 to 2006, SGC 2001; from 2007 to 2011, SGC 2006; from 2012 to 2015, SGC 2011; as of 2016, SGC 2016. Please note that census agglomerations were introduced in this CANSIM table in 2008."
12,"As of 2016, the census agglomeration (CA) of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu has been merged into the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Montréal."
