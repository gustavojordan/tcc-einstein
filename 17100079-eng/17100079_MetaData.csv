1,"Population estimates based on the Standard Geographical Classification (SGC) 2011 as delineated in the 2011 Census."
2,"A census metropolitan area (CMA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre (known as the core). A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000 of which 50,000 or more must live in the core. To be included in the CMA, other adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the core, as measured by commuting flows derived from previous census place of work data. Once an area becomes a CMA, it is retained as a CMA even if its total population declines below 100,000 or the population of its core falls below 50,000. Small population centres with a population count of less than 10,000 are called fringe. All areas inside the CMA that are not population centres are rural areas. All CMAs are subdivided into census tracts."
3,"The estimates for deaths are preliminary for 2016/2017, updated for 2013/2014 to 2015/2016 and final up to 2012/2013. Preliminary and updated estimates of deaths were produced by Demography Division, Statistics Canada (see definitions, data sources and methods record number <a href=""http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/3601-eng.htm"">3601</a> and <a href=""http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/3608-eng.htm"">3608</a>), with the exception of Quebec's data, which are taken from the estimates of ""l'Institut de la statistique du Québec"" (ISQ) and then adjusted to Statistics Canada's provincial estimates. Final data were produced by Health Statistics Division, Statistics Canada (see definitions, data sources and methods record number <a href=""http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/3233-eng.htm"">3233</a>). However, before 2011, the final estimates may differ from the data released by the Health Statistics Division due to the imputation of certain unknown values. In addition, for estimates of deaths, the age represents age at the beginning of the period (July 1st) and not the age at the time of occurrence, as with the Health Statistics Division data."
4,"The estimates for immigrants are preliminary for 2016/2017 and final up to 2015/2016."
5,"The estimates for emigrants are preliminary for 2016/2017, updated for 2013/2014 to 2015/2016 and final up to 2012/2013."
6,"The estimates for returning emigrants are preliminary for 2016/2017, updated for 2013/2014 to 2015/2016 and final up to 2012/2013."
7,"The estimates for net temporary emigrants are preliminary for 2016/2017, updated for 2013/2014 to 2015/2016 and final up to 2012/2013."
8,"The estimates for net interprovincial migrant are preliminary for 2016/2017 and final up to 2015/2016."
9,"The estimates for net intraprovincial migrant are preliminary for 2016/2017 and final up to 2015/2016. For Quebec’s census metropolitan areas, preliminary and final data (from 2011/2012) are taken from the estimates of ""l'Institut de la statistique du Québec"" (ISQ). In rare instances, it may have been necessary to modify ISQ’s estimates in order to avoid generating negative populations with the cohort component approach. With the exception of Quebec's data, there is no preliminary data source available for intraprovincial migration and we assume the same level of migration as the previous year. Estimates for the last two years are therefore identical for this component."
11,"The estimates for net non-permanent resident are preliminary for 2016/2017, updated for 2013/2014 to 2015/2016 and final up to 2012/2013."
12,"The five following groups are referred to as non-permanent residents (NPR): (1) persons with a usual place of residence in Canada who are claiming refugee status; (2) persons with a usual place of residence in Canada who hold a study permit; (3) persons with a usual place of residence in Canada who hold a work permit; (4) persons with a usual place of residence in Canada who hold a minister's permit (including extensions); (5) All non-Canadian born dependants of persons claiming refugee status, or of persons holding study permits, work permits or minister's permits and living in Canada."
13,"Age at July 1."
14,"Age -1 year represents persons born after July 1 and not included in age group 0 to 4 years."
15,"The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates of Census metropolitan areas (CANSIM 051-0056), is comprised of the components of population growth (CANSIM 051-0057)."
16,"This table replaces CANSIM table 051-0047."
17,"The net non permanent residents (NPRs) are obtained by subtracting the stocks of NPRs as of July 1st of two consecutive years. As there are no reliable administrative data available to directly estimate net number of NPRs at the subprovincial level, the provincial/territorial estimates by age and sex are disaggregated by subprovincial area, age and sex on the basis of the distribution coming from the most recent census (or from the National Household Survey (NHS) in 2011). For the 2005/2006 and 2010/2011 years, the net NPRs are calculated using two different distributions, that is the 2001 and 2006 Censuses for the year 2005/2006, and the 2006 Census as well as the 2011 NHS for the year 2010/2011. This approach assumes that the two distributions are similar. If the two distributions of NPRs by subprovincial area vary, the net NPRs for years 2005/2006 and 2010/2011 will absorb all of the changes attributable to the difference between the two distributions that were used. For this reason, the net NPRs for years 2005/2006 and 2010/2011 should not be compared with the rest of the historical series."
18,"The estimates for births are preliminary for 2016/2017, updated for 2013/2014 to 2015/2016 and final up to 2012/2013. Preliminary and updated estimates of births were produced by Demography Division, Statistics Canada (see definitions, data sources and methods record number <a href=""http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/3601-eng.htm"">3601</a> and <a href=""http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/3608-eng.htm"">3608</a>), with the exception of Quebec's data, which are taken from the estimates of ""l'Institut de la statistique du Québec"" (ISQ) and then adjusted to Statistics Canada's provincial estimates. Final data were produced by Health Statistics Division, Statistics Canada (see definitions, data sources and methods record number <a href=""http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/3231-eng.htm"">3231</a>). However, before 2011, the final estimates included in this table may differ from the data released by the Health Statistics Division, due to the imputation of certain unknown values (province, territory or sex)."
19,"Residual deviation is obtained by distributing the error of closure linearly throughout the intercensal period. The error of closure is defined as the difference between the postcensal population estimates on Census Day and the population enumerated in that census adjusted for census net undercoverage and incompletely enumerated indian reserves."
20,"Please note that for the emigration, the returning emigration and the net temporary emigration, the estimates for the most recent periods are expected to be identical or very similar. In the absence of more up-to-date data sources, the assumption is made that levels remain similar."
21,"Please refer to table 17100136 for more recent data."
